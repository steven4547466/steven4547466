I'm Steven, I'm a programmer. I can do many things with multiple coding languages. I don't have many big coding projects going on right now, but I'm always looking to improve and do more.

I mainly use JavaScript, specifically Node.js, apart from that, though, I know Java, Python, HTML/CSS, a fair bit of Lua (why do your lists start at 1?), some php (but imagine using php in 2020). I'm certified in JavaScript and Python.

I'm currently a student at St. Clair County Community College and I'm looking to major in Computer Science and minor in mathematics. Through SC4, I should obtain an Associates degree and I want to transfer that to Michigan Tech, or another University.

I develop mainly back-end projects and I'm not very good at design or front end. A lot of my public projects have some really bad code, but most of them are from quite some time ago.

### What am I doing with my life right now?

Oh boy have I advanced so quickly in my C# endevours. However, I did expect this because I have taken classes in school that taught java, and they are really similar languages. C# is literally java microsoft edition.

I'm investing a lot of time into my [AdvancedSubclassing](https://github.com/steven4547466/AdvancedSubclassing) SCP:SL plugin. It's come a really long way and I'm happy with it. This plugin can do basically what other plugins do, all in one. If you wanted Serpents Hand? Make a SH subclass that only affects spawn waves. Want people to have cool abilites? Give them the abilities then! Want to request abilites? Then contact me at one of the listed contacts below and we can talk. I have big plans for the initial release of this plugin, but I want the first full release to be as bug-free as possible. So it's going to stay in its "pre" stage until that's done.
