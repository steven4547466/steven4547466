I'm Steven, I'm a programmer. I can do many things with multiple coding languages. I don't have many big coding projects going on right now, but I'm always looking to improve and do more.

I mainly use JavaScript, specifically Node.js, apart from that, though, I know Java, Python, HTML/CSS, a fair bit of Lua (why do your lists start at 1?), some php (but imagine using php in 2020). I make minecraft plugins, discord bots, and develop for money on fiverr. I'm certified in JavaScript and Python.

I'm currently a student at St. Clair County Community College and I'm looking to major in Computer Science and minor in mathematics. Through SC4, I should obtain an Associates degree and I want to transfer that to Michigan Tech, or another University.

I develop mainly back-end projects and I'm not very good at design or front end. A lot of my public projects have some really bad code, but most of them are from quite some time ago.
