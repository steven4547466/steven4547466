I'm Steven, I'm a programmer (obviously). I can do many things with multiple coding languages. I don't have many big coding projects going on right now, but I'm always looking to improve and do more.

I mainly use JavaScript, specifically Node.js, apart from that, though, I know Java, Python, HTML/CSS, a fair bit of Lua (why do your lists start at 1?), some php (but imagine using php in 2020). I'm certified in C# (Software Development Fundamentals), JavaScript, Python, and HTML/CSS. You can see them [here](https://www.youracclaim.com/users/steven-webster.6f16f8c9/badges).

I mainly develop projects that don't have UI or anything fancy and I'm not very good at design or front end. A lot of my public projects have some really bad code, but most of them are from quite some time ago.
